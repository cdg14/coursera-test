<h1>3 Days Prayer</h1>

<div class="container-fluid">
<div class="row">
  <div  class="col-md-4 col-sm-6 col-xs-12" id="d1">
  	 <h3>Day 1</h3> <p>Our Father which art in heaven,
Hallowed be thy name.
Thy kingdom come.
Thy will be done in earth,
as it is in heaven.
Give us this day our daily bread.
And forgive us our trespasses,
as we forgive those
that trespass against us... Amen.</p> </div>
  <div class="col-md-4 col-sm-6 col-xs-12" id="d2"> <h3>Day 2</h3> <p>Remember, O most gracious Virgin Mary,
that never was it known 
that anyone who fled to thy protection, 
implored thy help, 
or sought thy intercession, 
was left unaided. 
Inspired by this confidence 
I fly unto thee, 
O Virgin of virgins, my Mother. 
To thee do I come, 
before thee I stand...
Amen.</p> </div>
  <div class="col-md-4 col-sm-12 col-xs-12" id="d3"> <h3>Day 3</h3> <p>Hail, Holy Queen, Mother of Mercy, 
our life, our sweetness and our hope.
To you do we cry,
poor banished children of Eve. 
To you do we send up our sighs, 
mourning and weeping in this valley of tears 
Turn then, most gracious advocate,...
show unto us the blessed fruit of thy womb,
Jesus...
Amen.</p> </div>
